# LAMP (Language Acquisition Made Practical)

## "Monday", "Tuesday", "Week 1", and so on
LAMP involves building up a "cycle" which you are originally meant to follow and expand upon every day (see the assumptions of the original book).

I've already noticed that with stricter time constraints, it is not really possible to commit to a policy of doing a complete cycle each day. The original book actually calls the beginning stages "Monday", "Tuesday" and so on, but there is of course no reason why you should have to start on any particular day of the week; start whenever you like. And just see it as a progression of learning more and more about the process.

I've started simply to call the original weekdays "day 1" and so on, but even that should not be taken literally.
