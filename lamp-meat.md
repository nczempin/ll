# LAMP (Language Acquisition Made Practical)

# Overview

LAMP as I understand it primarily involves a language helper (native speaker) who records phrases that the language learner uses for practice. Recording means that the helper only needs to help a few times, and the learner can listen to the recordings as many times as necessary without bothering the helper.

The phrases are chosen by the learner and helper together; the learner comes up with things he's like to be able to talk about, and the helper comes up with how to say these things naturally in their native language.

## "Monday", "Tuesday", "Week 1", and so on
LAMP involves building up a "cycle" which you are originally meant to follow and expand upon every day (see the assumptions of the original book).

I've already noticed that with stricter time constraints (the original book is based on being a field linguistics researcher, language acquisition and transcription being the primary activity), it is not really possible to commit to a policy of doing a complete cycle each day. The original book actually calls the beginning stages "Monday", "Tuesday" and so on, but there is of course no reason why you should have to start on any particular day of the week; start whenever you like. And just see it as a progression of learning more and more about the process.

I've started simply to call the original weekdays "day 1" and so on, but even that should not be taken literally.
