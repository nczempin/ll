# ll: Enhanced Directory Listing Tool

## What Problem Does This Solve?
The `ll` tool provides an enhanced directory listing experience, extending the functionality of the standard Unix `ls -l` command. It aims to make file and directory information more readable, colorful, and informative for command-line users, improving productivity when navigating and managing filesystems.

## Who Is This For?
- Command-line users who frequently work with file listings
- System administrators managing complex directory structures
- Developers who want more readable file information
- Anyone looking to enhance their terminal workflow

## Current Implementation Status
- ðŸš§ Basic directory listing functionality
- ðŸš§ Colorized output for different file types
- ðŸ“‹ Enhanced metadata display
- ðŸ“‹ Sorting and filtering options
- ðŸ“‹ Configuration and customization features

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, BSD)
- Basic understanding of command-line interfaces

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nczempin/ll.git
   cd ll
   ```

2. Build the tool (when implementation is available):
   ```
   make
   ```

3. Install to your system (when implementation is available):
   ```
   sudo make install
   ```

### Usage
```
ll [options] [directory]
```

## Project Scope

### What This IS
- An enhanced directory listing tool for Unix-like systems
- A learning project for systems programming
- A tool to improve terminal workflow productivity

### What This IS NOT
- Not a full file manager with advanced features
- Not a GUI application
- Not intended to replace all functionality of standard Unix tools

## Repository Structure
- Currently in early planning/development stage
- Structure will evolve as implementation progresses

## Development Status
This is an experimental project in early development. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
