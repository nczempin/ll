# LAMP ("Language Acquisition Made Practical")

## Why do I use it?
My two main goals for using it are
1. to improve my pronunciation and
2. to get me actually speaking to native speakers of Chinese
much faster than is usually the case (probably at the expense of efficiency in other areas).


## What is it?
For that I am using the principles described in a book called  [Language Acquisition Made Practical"](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Acquisition-Made-Practical-Learners/dp/B0054RBDSM/).
I find this book very useful, but it does have some drawbacks that make it less than ideal:

It assumes that
* you are in a foreign country with ubiquitous access to local native speakers
* you can spend six hours or more on just learning the language
* you have a single person who will assist you in learning the language every day.

None of these are true for me for any extensive period of time.

It is also a fairly old book, originally published in 1976. As such, it talks about using technology such as cassette recorders, and does not take advantage of the myriad ways in which technology can help us with learning languages in the 21st century.

But I'm not letting that stop me; the principles are sound enough that I am willing to find ways to adapt the method to my personal situation and to take advantage of modern technology and its consequences.

## How am I using it?
I want to use this method in the "Chinese section" of my tandem sessions, and the web site helps me explain what I would like my tandem partners to do (it involves recording as well as drilling me on some phrases, and also I will ask them  to provide some examples of phrases that native speakers would use).
