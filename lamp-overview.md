# LAMP ("Language Acquisition Made Practical") Background Information

## What is it?
LAMP is a method that lets you "learn any language". It is described in a book originally written in 1976, called [Language Acquisition Made Practical](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Acquisition-Made-Practical-Learners/dp/B0054RBDSM/).

## Why do I use it?
My two main goals for using it are
1. to improve my pronunciation and
2. to get me actually speaking to native speakers of Chinese
much faster than is usually the case (probably at the expense of efficiency in other areas).

When I encountered the book for the first time, it occurred to me that its contents would probably help me tremendously with my goals. I'm sure it can also help people who are in a different situation than I am, but I haven't looked into that in any amount of detail.

## What am I doing with it?

### Assumptions of the Book
I find the method laid out in the LAMP book very useful, but it does have some drawbacks that make it less than ideal:

It assumes that
* you are in a foreign country with ubiquitous access to local native speakers
* you can spend six hours or more on just learning the language
* you have a single person who will assist you in learning the language every day.

**None of these are true for me for any extensive period of time.**

### Showing its Age
It is also a fairly old book, originally published in 1976. As such, it talks about using technology such as cassette recorders, and does not take advantage of the myriad ways in which technology can help us with learning languages in the 21st century.

### I'm Adapting it to the Modern Age
But I'm not letting that stop me; the principles are sound enough that I am willing to find ways to adapt the method to my personal situation and to take advantage of modern technology and its consequences.

## What's this Web site for?

### Record my own adaptations
Since I am changing things around with this method, so it works better in my own situation, I want to have a place where I can keep track of everything that I am doing and what I'm changing, and I find a website to be a convenient, easily-changeable place to do so.

### Guidelines for Helpers and Learners
I want to use this method in the "Chinese section" of my tandem sessions, and the web site helps me explain what I would like my tandem partners to do (it involves recording as well as drilling me on some phrases, and also I will ask them  to provide some examples of phrases that native speakers would use).

### Enough with all the Talking! Show me the Meat!

## Some Notes on "Process" or "Method"

I have a little bit of a background in Software Process Development (setting up processes for individuals or teams of programmers and other software project team members to follow). And my personal opinion is that no process that you take from a book or a website will be ideal for your exact situation. It can only be a hopefully decent starting point, but you should change anything that doesn't work for you to something that does. Leave out stuff, add your own stuff, **the most important part of a process is that you actually follow it**. There is no point in developing a process that will just collect dust on the shelf.
