## Help Me Prepare
### Decide on the Text
"The text" is the following, roughly (but not necessarily literally) translated; please convey the meaning of the following in a manner that is natural in your language)

1. **Hello.** [A greeting that can be used informally or formally when you greet a stranger for the first time)
2. **I'm learning (name of language).**
3. **This is all I can say (for now).** [My proficiency in (name of language) does not allow me to say anything else; I'm not good enough for anything else]
4. **Good-bye.** [this conversation is over and I will leave now, I am unable to communicate with you any further because I don't know how]

### Initially Record the Text and Refine it

1. Record the entire text twice. Make sure to say it in a natural manner, as if you were casually saying it to another native speaker. In particular, please do not speak overly clearly or slowly.
2. Does it sound smooth and natural? Would it be OK for me to say it to random people?
3. I may find it too difficult. Do you think it could be simplified and/or shortened? If so, please go back to step 1
4. Help me to transcribe the final recording. (Initially only you can do this, later please check my efforts).
5. Help me identify which parts are difficult, and note them in the transcription

### Record the Text Multiple Times in Specific Formats, for Later Practice

Record three simple exercises that will help you say your text with help you say your text with flow and confidence.

#### Recording 1:

Say (in English):
"Whole Text Listening Drill. Listen Only"
and then follow with the entire text in your language in a smooth and natural way,
3 successive times without interruption.

#### Recording 2:

Say (in English)
"Sentence Mimicry Drill - Part A. Mimic each sentence during the pause"
and then follow by saying each phrase three times, leaving a pause long enough to say the phrase again (imagine me whispering it during the pause).

So that means
1. Read the first sentence once
2. leave a pause long enough for the sentence.
3. Repeat the sentence
4. and the pause
5. repeat the sentence again
6. and the pause 
then continue by reading the second sentence again, and go through steps 
before moving on to the next sentence, and repeat the above steps for each sentence.

#### Recording 3:

Say (in English):
"Sentence Mimicry Drill - Part B. Mimic each sentence during the pause"

then read each sentence just once and leave a pause long enough for me to repeat it:
1. Read first sentence once
2. pause 
3. read second sentence
4. pause

and so on.

## Help Me Practice With You
#### I Listen
Say the entire text three times; I will simply listen.
#### I Mimic
Say the text and let me repeat each sentence.

If any one sentence is too difficult for me to repeat, help me start with a smaller chunk of the sentence, starting at the end:
1. Say the last word or couple of words and let me repeat.
2. Repeat this at least three times, if I cannot repeat it, split it up into even smaller pieces. IF it still too difficult after three to five minutes, let's move on to the next sentence for now 

Remember to speak at a normal pace and in a natural way, do not speak extra slow for me.
#### Produce
For each sentence:
1. Say just the first word or two of each sentence.
2. I will then repeat these one or two words and continue to say the entire sentence on my own
3. Say the entire sentence

Do the whole thing at least three times

Finally you're done for the "day". I'm sure you're bored by now.

I will later practice with the recordings on my own.
