## Monday<a name="Monday"/>

Focus on *fluency*.

## Prepare

### Obtain
#### Elicit the text
"The text" is roughly (but not necessarily literally translated; please convey the meaning of the following in a manner that is natural in your language)

> Hello. [A greeting that can be used informally or formally when you greet a stranger for the first time)

> I'm learning (name of language).

> This is all I can say (for now). [My proficiency in (name of language) does not allow me to say anything else; I'm not good enough for anything else]

> Good-bye. [this conversation is over and I will leave now, I am unable to communicate with you any further because I don't know how]

#### Record and Refine the Text initially

1. Record the entire text twice. Make sure to say it in a natural manner, as if you were casually saying it to another native speaker. In particular, please do not speak overly clearly or slowly.
2. Does it sound smooth and natural? Would it be OK for me to say it to random people?
3. I may find it too difficult. Do you think it could be simplified and/or shortened? If so, please go back to step 1
4. Help me to transcribe the final recording. (Initially only you can do this, later please check my efforts).
5. Help me identify which parts are difficult, and note them in the transcription

### Record the Text Multiple Times in Specific Formats, for Later Practice

Record three simple exercises that will help you say your text with help you say your text with flow and confidence.

Recording 1:

Say (in English):
"Whole Text Listening Drill. Listen Only"
and then follow with the entire text in your language in a smooth and natural way,
3 successive times without interruption.

Recording 2:

Say (in English)
"Sentence Mimicry Drill - Part A. Mimic each sentence during the pause"
and then follow by saying each phrase three times, leaving a pause long enough to say the phrase again (imagine me whispering it during the pause).

So that means
1. Read the first sentence once
2. leave a pause long enough for the sentence.
3. Repeat the sentence
4. and the pause
5. repeat the sentence again
6. and the pause 
then continue by reading the second sentence again, and go through steps 
before moving on to the next sentence, and repeat the above steps for each sentence.

#### Sentence Mimicry Drill - Part B
1. Read first sentence once
2. pause 
3. read second sentence
4. pause

and so on.

## Practice

### Practice With Your Helper

#### Listen

#### Mimic

Break sentences that are too long into multiple phrases and practice them, **starting at the end**, using the 
##### Build-up mimicry drill

Do not follow the transcript, train your ears instead.

For difficult sounds that you do not seem to get, move on for now if you don't get them after three to five minutes.

Pay close attention to intonation (melody), emphasis and rhythm of each sentence.

#### Produce

##### Completion Production Drill

### Practice with the Recording

Objective is to get the text down pat and to develop confidence in your ability to say it.

You will have learned the text when you can easily say it without stumbling (at normal speed).

It will probably be necessary to work through the drills 3-4 times or more.

Keep the meaning in mind.

#### Sentence Production Drill
Produce the sentence before the recording.

Repeat until each phrase no hesitation.

#### Simultaneous Production Drill

#### Entire Speech Without Reinforcement or Help

#### Wrap up

Confidence and fluency are relative

## Communicate What You Know

Try your speech on 30 - 50 people.

## Evaluate

### Evaluate Procedures

### Note and Classify

### Decide on Next Step

### Organize New Material

# Tuesday<a name="Tuesday"/>

Will begin to learn various techniques for gaining *accuracy*.

Elicit a text from the helper based on a given *setting* (avoid using your L1).

## Obtain the Text

### Describe the setting
Two people
#### Greeting
#### Expand on "I want to learn to speak (the language)"
#### "This all I can say"
#### How to thank someone
#### What to say when you want to leave after talking

# Wednesday<a name="Wednesday"/>
Now you know how to initiate and terminate a conversation.

The opening and closing of conversations will remain fairly constant; the body will has unlimited options.

Now you will learn how to say something about yourself.

Plus a new drill called Pronunciation Substitution Drill

# Thursday<a name="Thursday"/>

Today you will begin to use "helping questions" (interrogatives) in the target language.

Differential Pronunciation and Differential Structure drills
