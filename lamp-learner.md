Please note that this is still woefully incomplete.
# Monday
## Obtain
### Elicit the text
The basic idea to get across is this:
> Hello.
I'm learning (name of language).
This is all I can say.
Good-bye.
### Record the text
Have the helper record the entire text one or two times.
## Check
### Suitable for him?
Does the recorded text sound smooth and natural to your helper? Will it be OK for you to say this to random people?
### Suitable for you?
If it is too long or too difficult, try and shorten it.
Record the text again and re-check if it sounds natural.
## Transcribe
Record the final version of the text. Initially this will be done by the helper, later, you will do it yourself.
## Understand
For now you have a rough idea, because you asked for the text.
## Note Opportunities and Classify
Note and classify new sounds and sentence patterns.

Note mistakes/problems and classify them. For example

1. pronunciation problems
  a) which sounds are difficult?
  b) which sounds does your helper correct you on?
  c) at what point do you stumble?
Draw a wavy line under these points in the transcript
2. grammatical structures
3. needed vocabulary
4. topics you want to talk about
## Record
# Tuesday
The text for today is more like this:

 A: "Hello."
 
 B: "Hello."

 B: "Fine, and you?"
 
 A: "Fine.<br/>
    I want to learn [language].<br/>
    I have been learning [language] for [four weeks].<br/>
    This is all I can say."<br/>
    
 B: "You are doing fine."
 
A: "Thank you.<br/>
    Well, I'm going now."
    
 B: "OK."
 
A: "Good-bye."

B: "Good-bye."
