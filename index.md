# My Language Learning

## Overview

I am currently learning a foreign language.

Because I am not following a course or need to get a certificate, I am not constrained to reach a certain level by a certain date; I can set my own goals.

That said, I do find the structure that [CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages) imposes useful as guidelines/baselines for my own activities.

### Group Classes
I'm not a big fan of attending a group class (although at some point I may very well attend one in addition to my other activities), because they feel to me to have too much of a "one size fits all" approach (which they obviously do out of necessity).

### Individual Classes
I am not opposed to individual professional teaching; I use it to supplement my own activities; I believe "the teacher can only open the door, the learner has to step through on their own". I do not wait until the teacher tells me what to do (although I do like their feedback in terms of "what do you think my priorites should be in the medium term, based on my current progress?").  Actually I like this feedback from everyone, but I will probably weigh the advice from professionals somewhat higher.

## Independent Learning

### Each learner
Every learner is at a different place, they will all have
* different situations (some are already in the foreign country, surrounded by native speakers, some just learn from their couch at home)
* different backgrounds (any previous contact with the language, knowledge of any related languages?)
* different goals (some want to become "fluent", some need a certificate to study or work, some just want to read literature)
* different levels (in spoken and written language, and within that you can differentiate between many other things, for example fluency, pronunciation, being correct in terms of grammar.
### Collecting Ideas/Methods

So here on this website, I'd like to collect useful tips on how to learn various parts of languages, primarily for my own use.
However, in my language learning journey (through language exchange programmes such as italki, HelloTalk, Tandem, my local language exchange meetup...) met many people who want to learn languages, primarily my own native language (German), a lot of people who want to improve their English, but also many other languages. And I will try to make clear when I think something is specific to a certain language or if it could be used with any language.

### Keeping Track of my Progress

I also want to describe, primarily to myself and to my teachers, my goals and my current levels in the various parts of learning Chinese.

I am doing a lot more things than I am describing here; sometimes I have to force myself to just do more actual language learning than just talking about it.

## Concrete Methods

### LAMP (Language Acquisition Made Practical)
For now I am describing my version of a [process that you can use to improve in any language](lamp-overview).
