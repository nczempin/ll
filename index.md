title: "Language Acquisition Made Practical"
---
I am collecting ideas on how to efficiently learn all the different aspects of language acquisition, primarily from the point of view of an independent learner (who may or may not be assisted by professional teaching, but the responsibility lies squarely with the learner).

For now (I'd like to expand this a lot, later):

I am just summarizing the basic contents from a book called [Language Acquisition Made Practical"](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Acquisition-Made-Practical-Learners/dp/B0054RBDSM/).

I want to use this method in the "Chinese section" of my tandem sessions, and the web site helps me explain what I would like my tandem partners to do (it involves recording as well as drilling me on some phrases, and also I will ask them  to provide some examples of phrases that native speakers would use).

## Monday<a name="Monday"/>

Focus on *fluency*.

## Prepare

### Obtain
#### Elicit the text
The basic idea to get across is this:
> Hello.
> I'm learning (name of language).
> This is all I can say.
> Good-bye.

#### Record the text

Have the helper record the entire text one or two times.

### Check
#### Suitable for him?
Does the recorded text sound smooth and natural to your helper? Will it be OK for you to say this to random people?
#### Suitable for you?
If it is too long or too difficult, try and shorten it.
Record the text again and re-check if it sounds natural.
### Transcribe
Record the final version of the text. Initially this will be done by the helper, later, you will do it yourself.
### Understand
For now you have a rough idea, because you asked for the text.
### Note Opportunities and Classify
Note and classify new sounds and sentence patterns.

Note mistakes/problems and classify them. For example

1. pronunciation problems
  a) which sounds are difficult?
  b) which sounds does your helper correct you on?
  c) at what point do you stumble?
Draw a wavy line under these points in the transcript
2. grammatical structures
3. needed vocabulary
4. topics you want to talk about

### Record

Record three simple exercises that will help you say your text with help you say your text with flow and confidence.

#### Whole Text Listening Drill
Instructions: "Listen Only"
Record the entire text 3 successive times without interruption.

#### Sentence Mimicry Drill - Part A
Instructions: "Mimic each sentence during the pause"
1. Read each sentence once
2. leave a pause long enough for the sentence.
2. Repeat the sentence
4. and the pause twice
5. repeat the sentence again
6. and the pause 

before moving on to the next sentence, and repeat for each sentence.

In the pauses, silently voice the sentence to find a good pause length.
#### Sentence Mimicry Drill - Part B
1. Read first sentence once
2. pause 
3. read second sentence
4. pause

and so on.

## Practice

### Practice With Your Helper

#### Listen

#### Mimic

Break sentences that are too long into multiple phrases and practice them, **starting at the end**, using the 
##### Build-up mimicry drill

Do not follow the transcript, train your ears instead.

For difficult sounds that you do not seem to get, move on for now if you don't get them after three to five minutes.

Pay close attention to intonation (melody), emphasis and rhythm of each sentence.

#### Produce

##### Completion Production Drill

### Practice with the Recording

Objective is to get the text down pat and to develop confidence in your ability to say it.

You will have learned the text when you can easily say it without stumbling (at normal speed).

It will probably be necessary to work through the drills 3-4 times or more.

Keep the meaning in mind.

#### Sentence Production Drill
Produce the sentence before the recording.

Repeat until each phrase no hesitation.

#### Simultaneous Production Drill

#### Entire Speech Without Reinforcement or Help

#### Wrap up

Confidence and fluency are relative

## Communicate What You Know

Try your speech on 30 - 50 people.

## Evaluate

### Evaluate Procedures

### Note and Classify

### Decide on Next Step

### Organize New Material

# Tuesday<a name="Tuesday"/>

Will begin to learn various techniques for gaining *accuracy*.

Elicit a text from the helper based on a given *setting* (avoid using your L1).

## Obtain the Text

### Describe the setting
Two people
#### Greeting
#### Expand on "I want to learn to speak (the language)"
#### "This all I can say"
#### How to thank someone
#### What to say when you want to leave after talking

# Wednesday<a name="Wednesday"/>
Now you know how to initiate and terminate a conversation.

The opening and closing of conversations will remain fairly constant; the body will has unlimited options.

Now you will learn how to say something about yourself.

Plus a new drill called Pronunciation Substitution Drill

# Thursday<a name="Thursday"/>

Today you will begin to use "helping questions" (interrogatives) in the target language.

Differential Pronunciation and Differential Structure drills
