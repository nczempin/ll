# My Language Learning

I am currently learning Chinese independently, not because I need it for work or anything, but just for fun.

So I am not constrained to reach a certain level by a certain date; I can set my own goals.

That said, I do find the structure that HSK and CEFR impose useful as guidelines/baselines for my own activities.

I'm not a big fan of attending a group class (although at some point I may very well attend one in addition to my other activities), because they feel to me to have too much of a "one size fits all" approach.

I am not opposed to individual professional teaching; I use it to supplement my own activities; I believe "the teacher can only open the door, the learner has to step through on their own". I do not wait until the teacher tells me what to do (although I do like their feedback in terms of "what do you think my priorites should be in the medium term, based on my current progress?").  Actually I like this feedback from everyone, but I will probably weigh the advice from professionals somewhat higher.

I am collecting ideas on how to efficiently learn all the different aspects of independent language acquisition.
Every learner is at a different place, they will all have
* different backgrounds (any previous contact with the language, knowledge of any related languages?)
* different goals (some want to become "fluent", some need a certificate to study or work, some just want to read literature)
* different levels (in spoken and written language, and within that you can differentiate between many other things, for example fluency, pronunciation, being correct in terms of grammar; in written Chinese there are the simple and traditional characters, do you read them, write them, both?, how many characters can you recognize, are they based on useage frequency, on a textbook, on a system that will use simpler characters that later characters will have as parts, and so on...)

So here on this website, I'd like to collect useful tips on how to learn various parts of languages, primarily for my own use. However, in my journey to learn Chinese I have already (through language exchange programmes such as italki, HelloTalk, Tandem, my local language exchange meetup...) met many people who want to learn languages, primarily my own native language (German), a lot of people who want to improve their English, but also many other languages.

I also want to describe, primarily to my teachers, my goals and my current levels in the various parts of learning Chinese.

I am doing a lot more things than I am describing here; sometimes I have to force myself to just do more actual language learning than just talking about it.

For now I am describing a [process that I'm building up for my spoken Chinese](lamp-overview).
